# Sentiment Analysis: US Airline Twitter Data

## Objective
The purpose of this lab was to analyze customer sentiment from Twitter data related to US airlines and classify tweets as positive, neutral, or negative.

## Dataset
The dataset consisted of tweets mentioning US airlines, along with labeled sentiment categories. This dataset is commonly used for natural language processing (NLP) tasks.

## Approach
- Loaded and explored the text data
- Cleaned and preprocessed tweet text
- Converted text data into numerical features
- Applied a sentiment classification model
- Evaluated the model’s predictions

## What I Learned
- Basics of natural language processing (NLP)
- How text data differs from numerical data
- The importance of data cleaning in NLP tasks
- How machine learning can be applied to real-world social media data

## Challenges
Text preprocessing was challenging because tweets often contain noise such as emojis, hashtags, and abbreviations. Handling this correctly was important for model performance.

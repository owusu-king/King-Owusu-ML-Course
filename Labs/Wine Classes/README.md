# Wine Class Classification Lab

## Objective
The objective of this lab was to classify wine samples into different classes based on their chemical properties using machine learning techniques.

## Dataset
The Wine dataset contains multiple numerical features describing chemical characteristics of wine samples, along with class labels representing different wine categories.

## Approach
- Explored and analyzed the dataset
- Normalized and prepared data for modeling
- Built a classification model
- Evaluated the model using accuracy metrics

## What I Learned
- Working with datasets that contain many numerical features
- The importance of feature scaling
- How classification models behave with complex datasets

## Challenges
Understanding the role each chemical feature played in classification required careful exploration and interpretation of the data.

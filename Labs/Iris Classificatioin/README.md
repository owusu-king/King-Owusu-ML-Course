# Iris Classification Lab

## Objective
The goal of this lab was to build a machine learning model that classifies iris flowers into different species based on their physical measurements, such as sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.

## Dataset
The Iris dataset is a well-known dataset commonly used for introductory machine learning tasks. It contains labeled examples for three iris species:
- Setosa
- Versicolor
- Virginica

## Approach
- Loaded and explored the dataset
- Performed basic data preprocessing and visualization
- Split the data into training and testing sets
- Trained a classification model
- Evaluated the model’s performance using accuracy

## What I Learned
- How classification problems work in supervised learning
- How to prepare data for machine learning models
- The importance of train/test splits
- How to evaluate a model’s performance

## Challenges
One challenge was understanding how different features influenced the classification. Visualization helped make the relationships clearer.

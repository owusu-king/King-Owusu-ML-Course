# Assignment 1: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using Google Colab

## Problem Description
The goal of this assignment was to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a dataset using Google Colab. The focus was on understanding the data rather than building a perfect machine learning model.

## Approach
- Loaded the dataset into Google Colab
- Inspected data structure and types
- Checked for missing values and outliers
- Created visualizations to understand feature distributions
- Identified patterns and relationships within the data

## Results and Insights
The analysis revealed important trends and relationships that could influence machine learning models. Visualizations helped identify dominant features and potential data issues.

## What I Learned
- How to use Google Colab effectively
- The importance of EDA before modeling
- How visualization supports decision-making in data science

## Challenges
Choosing the right plots to clearly represent the data was challenging, but experimenting helped improve clarity.

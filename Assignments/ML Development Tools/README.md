# Assignment 2: Machine Learning Development Tools

## Problem Description
This assignment focused on understanding and using various tools commonly used in machine learning development workflows.

## Tools Explored
- Google Colab
- Jupyter Notebooks
- Python libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, and Scikit-learn
- Git and GitHub for version control

## Approach
- Explored how different tools fit into the ML workflow
- Practiced managing notebooks and datasets
- Used GitHub for organizing and documenting work

## Results and Outcomes
The assignment improved my understanding of how professional machine learning projects are developed, documented, and shared.

## What I Learned
- The importance of development tools in ML projects
- How version control improves collaboration and reproducibility
- Best practices for organizing ML projects

## Challenges
Learning how different tools interact took time, but hands-on practice made the workflow clearer.

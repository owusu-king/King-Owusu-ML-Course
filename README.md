# King Owusu – Machine Learning Course Portfolio

## Course: Introduction to Machine Learning

## About Me
My name is King Owusu, and I am a computer science student with a strong interest in machine learning and artificial intelligence. I am particularly interested in understanding how data can be transformed into meaningful insights and how machine learning models can be applied to real-world problems. This repository documents my hands-on learning journey through labs and assignments completed during this course.

## Repository Overview
This repository contains all labs and assignments completed for my machine learning course. Each project is organized into its own folder with clear documentation explaining the problem, approach, challenges, and lessons learned.

## Completed Labs
- Iris Classification
- Sentiment Analysis using US Airline Twitter Data
- Wine Class Classification

## Completed Assignments
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using Google Colab
- Machine Learning Development Tools

## Repository Structure
The repository follows a clean and organized structure with separate folders for labs and assignments. Each folder contains:
- A Jupyter Notebook with the implemented code
- A README.md file explaining the project and key learnings

This structure ensures clarity, ease of navigation, and professional presentation.
